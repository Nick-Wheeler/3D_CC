3D Printer cabinet temperature control. Including Kuman 4 relais board and GHT Temp sensors
The cabinet has a false bottom which houses a transformer for various voltages i.e. Pi3b, 12V PC Fans, Extractor Fan, 
and Hair dryer for heating. 
The hair dryer blows warm air under the false floor and through vents to gently heat the cabinet if required.
The extractor fan is situated in a vent stack at the top of cabinet for extracting gasses and fast heat reduction if required.
The PC fans (2x) are mounted in a side wall for gentle cooling of the cabinet.
The Temp. sensors are located in zones to control the different areas of the cabinet.
The code must control the temperature of the cabinet depending on the material and size of model being printed and the heat development 
during the printing process.
The Raspberry Pi, Relais and 7" touch screen are all located on the cabinet.
An eventual addition will be a humidity sensor in the material box located above the printer cabinet wich has a feed to the printer.
The material box has a 1kg bag of Silicagel in the bottom to keep the material dry.
